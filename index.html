# Setup
Let's dive in head first.

1. Create [github.com](github.com) account
1. Install [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/)
  - Super light users may prefer to use [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com)
  - Advanced users may prefer to use command lines
  - Linux users can use [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/download)

##### While you do that,
#VCS: version control system

---
# Version Control System

From Pro Git:

> Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later

> ...in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer. If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use

> ...Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.

---
# Version Control System

VCS is simply a **better Google Drive**

1. revert files back to a previous state
1. revert the entire project back to a previous state
1. compare changes over time
1. see who last modified something that might be causing a problem
1. who introduced an issue and when, and more.

# **How** to use Git & GitHub
1. Create
    - create repo (repository) on GitHub (README.md - markdown syntax)
    - clone repo to local (remote vs local)
1. Edit
    - stage files (.gitignore)
    - commit to local repo
    - see changelog & snapshots
    - push
1. Real Git: Collaborate
    - branch (off-topic: create blog with GitHub & Jekyll)
    - pull request

---
.left-column[
  ## Create
  ### - Create repo
]
.right-column[
1. In the upper right corner, next to your avatar or identicon, click `+` and then select `New repository`.
1. Name your repository.
1. Write a short description.
1. Select `Initialize this repository with a README`.
1. Click `Create repository`.

]
.right-column[
Let's write something in our README.md file:

A more descriptive explanation of what the repo is for, or how to use the files, etc.

If you made a repo for classwork, you can use this space for the syllabus.

.left-column[
  ## Create
  ### - Create repo
  ### - Clone repo into computer
]
.right-column[
1. In upper left corner, click `Clone/New`
1. If you have already signed in, you should see a globe icon. Click it to see your GitHub repos. Choose one and click `OK`.
1. Set which folder you want to save your repo in.
1. Check `Bookmark this repository` if it's not.
1. Click `Clone`.

.left-column[

  ### - Clone repo into computer
]
.right-column[
Check to see if you have the README.md file inside the folder.

You have successfully cloned your remote repository into your computer!

# Edit your files locally and update the remote repository
---
.left-column[
  ## Edit
  ### - stage files
]
.right-column[
  First step is to edit your files. Make some random files or edit ones you already have.

  When you create, edit, or delete files, the change will show up automatically in SourceTree.

  Let's `stage` it. This is the process of cherry-picking which files you want to update and which ones you want to ignore. The good thing about ignoring files is that you don't get dirty files that are in the middle of the sentence or a photo of yourself. (why would you have that tho)

  For example, let's create a text file with my secret identity in it and then ignore it in SourceTree.
]

---
.left-column[
  ## Edit
  ### - stage files
  ### - commit to local repo
]
.right-column[
  If you selected and staged which changes you want to keep online, write a short but explicit description of the changes you made and click `commit`. 

  Literally, committing means you are going to keep these changes. It means that the changes you made are kept inside a local repository.

  At this stage, the files online haven't been changed.
]

---
.left-column[
  ## Edit
  ### - stage files
  ### - commit to local repo
  ### - see changelog & snapshots
]
.right-column[
Once you made a commit, check the `History` tab of SourceTree. You can track all the changes you made. 

This function is similar to Google Docs's but you can keep it organized in a more systematic manner.

I'll talk about it later if I have time but this function is especially good for tracking whose change messed up the entire project. If that happens, we can always revert the changes.
]

---
.left-column[
  ## Edit
  ### - stage files
  ### - commit to local repo
  ### - see changelog & snapshots
  ### - push to remote repo
]
.right-column[
If you push or sync it, the local and the remote repository will probably have identical files and history logs.

Sometimes, when you're collaborating with people and someone already made a change to the remote repo, you might have to pick out which changes you want to keep. 

This can seem messy, but it's straightforward once you understand what the error messages mean.

Here's a diagram to help you imagine what we just did:
